# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Project
This is the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data from the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera.
The data was collected by a smartphone. A full description can be found [here]("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones").
The "run_analysis.R" script does the following:
* Downloads the data and loads it into R
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in the last step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
